## Contributing

As a solo project in active development, Lunaria is not currently open for general contributions. However, your interest is greatly appreciated.

### Future Plans for Collaboration

If there's significant interest in contributing to the project, I'm considering a complete rewrite with the following goals:

1. Implementing coding conventions and standardization
2. Establishing a structured development workflow
3. Creating a more collaborative-friendly architecture

This rewrite would aim to make Lunaria more accessible for multiple developers to work on simultaneously.
